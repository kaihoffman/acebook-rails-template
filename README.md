## Installing

To install a development instance locally clone this repository. Then:

```bash
> bundle install
> brew install imagemagick
```
 (assuming you are on a Mac. If you are on Linux, it will likely be bundled in your distro. This is required as the image handler gem, Paperclip, uses ImageMagick technology. It is only needed for running locally. Remote deployment on Heroku includes it on their dynos. For more information on Paperclip requirements see https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/paperclip/#requirements.)
```bash
> bin/rails db:create
> bin/rails db:migrate

> bundle exec rspec # Confirm all green
> bin/rails server
```
You can then connect to http://localhost:3000
